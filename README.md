# Instagram Feed for your own website!

Hope you enjoy this tool. Implement by copying the code and pasting between your (PHP-run) website's <body> tags.

8th November 2017: Instagram no longer allows requests to be made to https://instagram.com/username/media therefore I have updated it to fetch from https://instagram.com/username/?__a=1. 

<b>Latest EDIT</b> 16th November 2019: Instagram API deprecated -> Simple file_get_contents and regex magic to retrieve the images based off the permalink Instagram URL.
